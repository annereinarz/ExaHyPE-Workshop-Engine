     * Decompose floating point value
     *
     * Decomposes the input value into eight different variants with
     * 1,2,3,... bytes (chars) per mantissa. It also gives the errors.
     *
     * You may want to cast one of the integers into a sequence of chars
     * or other data types. While the array mantissa comprises long ints,
     * only the first kth bytes are used in the k-1th entry.
     *
     * Negative mantissa pose a challenge to the byte compression. Due to the
     * integer codes, we may not just hold negative values in the long ints.
     * -1 has all bits set, e.g. So if someone later only stores the minor k
     * bytes of mantissa, this will fail. So we restrict to unsigned values
     * first as we extract the sign and then multiply the biggest byte with
     * the sign in the end. This implies that the biggest byte of each
     * mantissa entry actually holds only seven digits.
     *
     * Please note that there are two compose() operations, i.e. two
     * counterparts of decompose(). Ensure you use the right one.
     *
     * @return exponent Sequence of exponents belonging to the eight decompositions.
     * @return mantissa Sequence of mantissas belonging to the eight decompositions.
     * @return error    Errors associated to the decompositions. They are all positive values.
     *
     * <h2> Bug/interoperability </h2>
     *
     * This operation works if and only if your system maps a long int onto a 64 bit value.
     *
     * We noticed that this operation yields invalid results with GCC if we
     * switch on optimisation. It works fine with ICC and any optimisation
     * level. We thus make the code translate with -O0 locally if ICC is not
     * used.
     *
     * <h2> Continue to work with results </h2>
     *
     * See decompose() how to continue to work with one of the result entries.

     * I run over the array of length count and check for every single entry

     * maxError constraint. This check relies on
     * findMostAgressiveCompression(double,double,bool). The routine then

     * <h2> Usage pattern </h2>
     *
     * This is the standard workflow:
     *
     * - Convert an array into its hierarchical representation. Usually, I
     *   determine the mean value and then store all remaining values within the
     *   array as actual value minus mean.
     * - Call this routine on the remaining array.
     * - If the result is bigger or equal 8, I store/send away the original
     *   array. Otherwise:
     * - I store the mean as 8 bytes into a char stream. I then loop over the
     *   array and per array entry call decompose. I know how many bytes of
     *   exponent and mantissa are valid from the result of this routine
     *   and thus enqueue only those guys in an output stream/MPI message.

     * There are two evergreens of pitfalls:
     *
     * - If you use push and pop to add stuff to the char heaps when you
     *   decompose, you have to invert all the accesses: you push the
     *   exponent first but you pop it last, and you pop the mantissas
     *   bytes in inverted order. I personally prefer to use a resize()
     *   command on the vector to avoid re-allocation and to access the
     *   vector entries directly (see snippet above). In this case, I
     *   could do without an inversion of access order.
     * - Please ensure that you set the long int mantissa above to 0!
     *   As you overwrite only parts of it (with compressed data), you
     *   might otherwise end up with garbage in the higher bytes.

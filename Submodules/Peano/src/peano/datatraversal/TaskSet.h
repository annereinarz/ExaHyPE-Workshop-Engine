/**
 * Task Set
 *
 * This is my very simple wrapper of task parallelism in Peano. The class
 * provides only one type of constructor. This constructor is passed a set of
 * instances representing one functor each. The constructor executes all of
 * them in parallel (if this is the user's wish) and returns. Consequently,
 * this wrapper is the right choice iff all the task are totally independent
 * of each other.
 *
 * The standard variants do not copy the task you hand in and I expect the
 * functors to be handed in as references. If the tasks are not independent
 * of each other, they thus might induce data races.
 *
 * Please see the documentation of the constructor with only one argument for
 * further details, as this one behaves differently.
 *
 * <h2> Issuing background tasks </h2>
 *
 * If you spawn a task, I cannot know when it is actually executed. As a
 * result, I never can rely where data is at the very moment the task then is
 * actually triggered. Notably if you directly try to access vertices/cells,
 * they might already have been moved to a different memory location. So what
 * you have to do is that you store the data you wanna manipulate on heaps as
 * data on heaps doesn't move. And then you equip your tasks with pointers
 * (indices) to the heap. These pointers/indices are copied but the heap index
 * itself remains valid, so it doesn't really matter to you if the vertex
 * holding pointers too moves around.
 *
 * If you want to get data back from a background tasks, you have to take into
 * account that the task you hand over to the TaskSet constructor is not directly executed
 *   if you declare it as background task.
 *   Instead, the runtime system makes a copy of your functor/task, stores it
 *   safely away and executes this one. That means once you hand over a
 *   functor, you can safely destroy this object. The tasking system has
 *   created a copy of its own.
 *
 * Please note that you notably should have a boolean flag somewhere that
 * indicates whether your task has terminated. I often store entries with
 * an enum on a heap. The enum encodes the states BackGroundTaskSpawned and
 * BackGroundTaskCompleted. I do protect the access to these enums with one
 * global semaphore to ensure that no two threads read/write it
 * simultaneously. If a task is spawned, the corresponding value on the heap is
 * set to BackGroundTaskSpawned. The operator() of the task sets the value to
 * BackGroundTaskCompleted as very last action. In a mapping where I need the
 * task result, I add a while loop that looks whether the task has already
 * terminated:
 *
 * <pre>
bool taskHasTerminated = false;
while (!taskHasTerminated) {
  tarch::multicore::Lock myLock(_globalBackgroundTaskStatusSemphore);
  taskHasTerminated = MyStatusHeap.getIndex(...).getStatus()==BackGroundTaskCompleted;
  myLock.free();
}
</pre>
 *
 * Alternatively, you can ask the tarch::multicore::jobs component whether all
 * background tasks have terminated.
 *
 * <h2> Number of background tasks </h2>
 *
 * I did occasionally run into situations where too many background tasks made the
 * overall system starve. So you can restrict the number of background tasks now
 * manually. The system queues all tasks and then checks whether a background task
 * is active already. If not, it launches a consumer task. See tarch::multicore::jobs.
 *
 * <h2> Difference of tasks and jobs</h2>
 *
 * In Peano, I prefer to speak of jobs rather than tasks. Tasks are atomic, i.e.
 * once they kick off, there are no further dependencies that they require to
 * terminate. Jobs in turn might internally wait for further input data. As a
 * consequence, jobs easily deadlock. Tasks are a special case of jobs.
 *
 * The name TaskSet consequently is not perfect. It should be JobSet. Anyway, you
 * can always tell Peano whether a job you pass is actually a task. If it is a
 * task, Peano can optimise the execution pattern.

    /**
     * Spawn One Task
     *
     * If you spawn one task, you have to clarify which type of task you spawn.
     * This is controlled through TaskType. See the documentation there.
     * Actually, it rarely makes sense to pass a job through this constructor
     * that is not some type of a background task, i.e. can run at any time
     * later without any further dependencies.
     *
     * <h2> Spawn task through a dedicated task class</h2>
     *
     * If you go down this route, then you write your own little class that
     * represents your job. The class has the following properties:
     *
     * - It has attributes that basically store all the data you require for
     *   this job to complete. If you job needs some parameters, the class
     *   needs local attributes. If your job has to write some global output
     *   data, your class needs a reference or pointer to these data.
     * - The class needs a constructor that initialises all class attributes.
     *   Please note that background tasks could be run at any time throughout
     *   the application execution. Hence, a job class may not hold references
     *   or pointers to local variables of the calling function.
     * - The class needs a functor that does the actual work.
     *
     * Here's an example of a  job class from the ExaHyPE project:
     * <pre>
class PredictionTask {
private:
  ADERDGSolver&    _solver;
  CellDescription& _cellDescription;
public:
  PredictionTask(
      ADERDGSolver&     solver,
      CellDescription&  cellDescription);
  void operator()();
};
       </pre>
     *
     * This task then is used as follows:
     * <pre>
PredictionTask predictionTask( myPointer, cellDescription );
peano::datatraversal::TaskSet spawnedSet( predictionTask, peano::datatraversal::TaskSet::TaskType::Background  );
       </pre>
     *
     *
     *
     * <h2> Lambda calculus </h2>
     *
     * In principle, you can simply pass in a lambda expression instead of a
     * defined functor:
     *
     * <pre>
peano::datatraversal::TaskSet backgroundTask(
  [=] () -> bool {
    // do something
    return false; // don't want to repeat this one forever
  },
  peano::datatraversal::TaskSet::TaskType::Background
);
       </pre>
     *
     * It is important that myFunctor catches everything via copy. As a
     * consequence do something only includes static and const accessors.
     *
     * Note: This interface is only used for tasks that do not have to run
     * persistently (in the background) for a very long time. It is only
     * to be used for tasks that are reasonably short. So you can use it if
     * your routine checks whether the tasks are all complete before it
     * terminates.

/**
 * The grain size object is the object a shared memory oracle returns for a
 * given section that could be parallelised. It encapsulates at first glance
 * only one integer, i.e. the grain size. However, it also ensures that, if the
 * oracle would like to get some feedback on the actual timing, such feedback
 * is provided once the object is destroyed (or explicitly closed). The class
 * design thus is very similar to TBB's lock.

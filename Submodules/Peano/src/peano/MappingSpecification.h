 * Specification for a mapping operation

 * on-the-fly optimisation.

<td>             </td><td> OnlyLeaves </td><td> Algorithm's semantics is preserved, if Peano kicks out the whole function call for refined vertices of cells that have solely refined vertices around them.  </td>

<td> multithreading </td><td> Serial               </td><td> Do not run these operation in parallel on a shared memory machine.
Application hence doesn't need semaphores. </td>
</tr><tr>
<td>                </td><td> RunConcurrentlyOnFineGrid </td><td> Peano runs the events in parallel on the finest grid, i.e. doesn't
 care about any data dependencies. For multiscale events such as
 ascend, this operation runs the code in parallel for all coarse
 grid cells. </td>
</tr><tr>
<td>                </td><td> AvoidCoarseGridRaces      </td><td> Peano can try to speed up the application due to multithreading.
 It ensures that events are invoked such that the coarse grid data
 (of enterCell, e.g.) is not shared with another thread. Is more
 restrictive than AvoidFineGridRaces, i.e. ensures this data
 consistency as well. Usually leads to colouring with @f$ 6^d @f$ or
 @f$ 7^d @f$ colors. </td>
</tr><tr>
<td>                </td><td> AvoidFineGridRaces  </td><td> Peano can try to speed up the application due to multithreading.
 However, Peano ensures that events are invoked such that the fine
 grid data (of enterCell, e.g.) is not shared with another thread.
 Introduces @f$ 2^d @f$ colouring on the cells.
 Variant is undefined (and thus may not be chosen) for inter-level
 events such as ascend.
 Variant seems to be unnecessary for touchVertex...Time events as
 those are not passed their neighbouring vertices anyway, i.e. there
 may not be any data races. However, if you work with pointers to
 adjacent cells, it can make sense to have this colouring.
 It introduces @f$ 2^d @f$ colouring on the vertices as well:
 If two vertices access their adjacent cells, no data races can occur,
 as @f$ 2^d @f$ colouring implies that only those vertices are processed
 concurrently which are at least separated by two faces along any coordinate
 axis.

 *
 * The order is Serial>AvoidCoarseGridRaces>AvoidFineGridRaces>RunConcurrentlyOnFineGrid.
 * If two mappings are combined one holding AvoidCoarseGridRaces and one holding
 * RunConcurrentlyOnFineGrid, the combination holds AvoidCoarseGridRaces.
 *
 * The state boolean is actually only required if you run the code with
 * shared memory parallelisation. On a multicore chip, the kernel may invoke
 * events in parallel. If a mapping's operation modifies the state, the code
 * has to copy the mapping to each thread before it starts the parallel
 * invocation, and it has to reduce the mappings via mergeWithWorker(...)
 * in the end. If the operations do not alter the state, we can skip the
 * copying and the reduction. We basically may assume that the event is
 * const.

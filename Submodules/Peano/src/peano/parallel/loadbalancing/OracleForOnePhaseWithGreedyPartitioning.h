/**
 * Simple Oracle
 *
 * This oracle is very straightforward. As long as no fork has failed, it tells
 * every asking node to fork once. If it is informed that a fork has failed, it
 * stops to ask for additional forks. If a worker has no cells anymore, the
 * oracle remembers this worker and tells to join this one the next time. As a
 * consequence it then continues to fork again.
